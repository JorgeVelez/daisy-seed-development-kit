Ensure you have LIBDAISY_DIR and DAISYSP_DIR environment variables set and pointing to the relevant libraries. If you are using Windows, ensure they use the forward slash. If you are on Linux, ensure the capitalisation is correct. You'll make your life a lot easier if you don't have spaces in the path.

ie:

LIBDAISY_DIR=/path/to/libdaisy
DAISYSP_DIR=/path/to/daisysp

make clean; make; make program-dfu;
